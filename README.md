## Budgeter
Budgeter is a simple python project allowing you to manage multiple budgets and bills within one account.

### What for?
Planning our home budgets having one account can be difficult. Usually we do not know how much money is left when we pay our monthly bills or spend some money on hobbies. Without such awareness it is easy to reach our account's limit.
