# Budgeter
Budgeter is a simple python project allowing you to manage multiple budgets and bills within one account.

## What for?
Planning our home budgets having one account can be difficult. Usually we do not know how much money is left when we pay our monthly bills or spend some money on hobbies. Without such awareness it is easy to reach our account's limit.

## Components:

### Account
The assumption is we operate within one account. You can treat it as one bank account when you have all your money for different purposes

### Budget
Budget is essentially an amount of money you want to spend on particular purpose.

3. Delete budget

### Bill

1. Delete bill
2. Pay the bill
